    <H1>Hi, I'm Rachel </H1>
    <h2>a UX/UI designer & Developer</h2>
<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
<p>I am a UX/UI designer and currently working on becoming a front-end developer. I reside in Atlanta, Georgia
    and I have keen attention to detail and a passion for design. When I was younger I always dreamed of doing 
    something that would help people and make me happy. <br> <br>
    
    I couldn't find anything that i truly loved for a long time until i came across a pintrest board advertising 
    how to start a blog without breaking the bank. I know you are probably thinking,"what does that have to do with
     developing and design?" Well, I'll tell you. <br> <br>
    
    It opened the door for possibility... you see for a long time I had been taking courses and classes on things 
    that i thought would make money and give me an enjoyable career. But i was looking in the wrong place. I have 
    taken courses in pharmacy, photography, marketing and more. Yet, none of them gave me the satisfation that the 
    design side of blogging gave me. From then on, i knew what i had to do. I had to finally go down the path that 
    was waiting for me. <br> <br>
    
    I started researching fervently, the best sites and courses to take to grow my understanding of web design and 
    developing. Thankfully I've had some help along the way, namely, my brother who is a full-stack developer and of 
    course, Google. With my family behind me and a killer design and developer course I am now on a path that i 
    have always longed for. "what happened to my blog you might ask?" I still have it and now i use it to further 
    promote my work and my intrests. If you would like to know about me and my journey feel free to stop by my blog
